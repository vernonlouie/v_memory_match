            <h2 id="one"> About Me </h2>
            <img src = "images/Vern_think.jpg" alt="Vern's head shot" width="400" />

            <p id = "aboutme"> My name is Vernon.  I am married with three children and I live in Los Angeles County.  I am currently unemployed, but am looking to                             change that with some further education from an institution called LearningFuze.  I enjoy playing basketball, exploring the national parks and taking the kids out to              playgrounds, museums and birthday parties.

            <h2> Skills </h2>
                <h3> Knot Tying </h3>
                    <p> This skill would come in handy when I resume my rock climbing.  Also it would open opportunities in being a boat person or longshoreman. </p>
                <h3> Tax Accounting </h3>
                    <p> I could help all my friends (and strangers) save money and then they would owe me favors.  And then I could use those favors to gain more                                       favors.  And then who knows what!
                    </p>
                <h3> Plumbing </h3>
                    <p> Come on now, everybody and their uncle needs a plumber.  The world cannot survive without plumbing.  There will never be a robot smart or                                       agile enough to replace a human plumber.  It can't be done.  It's one of the laws of nature.

        <h1 id="about_game"> About the Card Match Game </h1>
        <p> The game consists of 9 pairs of cards.  You must match the pairs is in the game of concentration.  You flip one card (by clicking) and it remains flipped.  You then flip another card to see if it matches.  If it matches, then you have discovered a matching pair and the two cards remain face up.  If it doesn't match, then the 2 cards go face down.  You then proceed to do another turn.  Once you have matched all 9 pairs, then the game ends and you can check your statistics (stats), which measure attempts and accuracy.  You can reset the game at any time by clicking on the "reset game" button.</p>
